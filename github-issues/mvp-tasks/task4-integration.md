# MVP Task 4: Connect Everything (Integration)

**Time Estimate**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: MVP Critical  
**Day**: 3  
**Labels**: `mvp-critical`, `component/integration`, `effort/2`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Wire hand tracking â†’ coordinate mapping â†’ robot rendering into a working end-to-end pipeline. This is where the magic happens!

## ðŸ“‹ MVP Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hand movements control robot in real-time
- [ ] Complete pipeline: MediaPipe â†’ Mapper â†’ Three.js Robot
- [ ] 20-30 FPS performance (acceptable for MVP)
- [ ] Basic error handling (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Proof of concept working start to finish

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Plan
1. **Create Integration Controller**:
   - Wire Tasks 1, 2, 3 together
   - Handle data flow between components
   - Add event loop for real-time updates

2. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   MediaPipe Hand Detection (Task 1)
   â†“ (thumb, index coordinates)
   Hand-Robot Mapper (Task 3)  
   â†“ (joint angles)
   Robot Visualization (Task 2)
   ```

3. **Main Integration Points**:
   - Update loop that runs continuously
   - Error handling for missing hands
   - Performance monitoring (FPS counter)

## ðŸ’¡ MVP Shortcuts
- Single-threaded processing (no async complexity)
- Basic error messages in console
- No sophisticated state management
- Direct function calls between components

## âœ… Definition of Done
- Moving hand controls robot arm in real-time
- System runs smoothly without crashes
- Can demonstrate hand â†’ robot control
- Ready for basic UI controls

## ðŸ”„ Next Task
Task 5: Basic UI Controls
