# MVP Task 6: Smooth Movement & Demo Polish

**Time Estimate**: 6 hours (3h smooth + 3h demo)  
**Priority**: MVP Demo Ready  
**Day**: 4  
**Labels**: `mvp-demo`, `component/polish`, `effort/3`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Add basic smoothing to reduce jitter and polish the system for a convincing 5-minute demo.

## Part A: Smooth Movement (3 hours)

### ðŸ“‹ Smoothing Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Simple moving average filter for hand coordinates
- [ ] Robot movements look reasonably smooth
- [ ] Balance between responsiveness and smoothness
- [ ] No complex Kalman filtering (keep it simple)

### ðŸ”§ Smoothing Implementation
```python
class SimpleMovingAverage:
    def __init__(self, window_size=5):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.history = []
    
    def update(self, value):
        self.history.append(value)
        if len(self.history) > self.window_size:
            self.history.pop(0)
        return sum(self.history) / len(self.history)
```

## Part B: Demo Polish (3 hours)

### ðŸ“‹ Demo Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reliable startup (works every time)
- [ ] Clear visual feedback when tracking is active
- [ ] Basic instructions displayed on screen
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully (no crashes)
- [ ] Ready for 5-minute demo presentation

### ðŸ”§ Demo Polish Implementation
1. **Visual Indicators**:
   - Show hand detection status
   - Highlight when robot is responding
   - Add simple on-screen instructions

2. **Reliability**:
   - Test startup sequence multiple times
   - Handle webcam permission issues
   - Graceful fallback when tracking fails

3. **Demo Script Preparation**:
   - Document 5-minute demo flow
   - Test demo multiple times
   - Prepare for common issues

## ðŸ’¡ Demo Script (5 minutes)
1. **Setup** (30s): "Let me show you our hand-controlled robot system"
2. **Hand Tracking** (1m): "First, we detect hand landmarks in real-time"
3. **Robot Simulation** (1m): "Here's our 3D robot arm simulation"
4. **Integration** (2m): "Now watch as my hand controls the robot..."
5. **Model Switch** (30s): "We can also switch between tracking models"
6. **Next Steps** (1m): "Future: multiple robots, real hardware, optimization"

## âœ… Definition of Done
- Movements are smooth enough for demo
- System starts reliably every time  
- Demo script tested and documented
- Ready to present working MVP
- Clear path forward for post-MVP features

## ðŸŽ‰ MVP Complete!
This completes the 4-day MVP sprint. Next phase: post-MVP enhancements based on feedback and priorities.
